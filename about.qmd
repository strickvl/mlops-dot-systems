I am an ML Engineer working at ZenML. This blog is a place for me to process and
share what I learn along the way.

I built [Ekko](https://ekko-realtime.com), an open-source framework allowing
developers to easily add realtime infrastructure and in-transit message
processing to web applications. I have multiple years of experience in the
Python, Ruby and JavaScript ecosystems and am comfortable working with Go,
PostgreSQL, AWS cloud infrastructure and Docker.

I have a PhD in History and authored several books based on my research work in
Afghanistan. I have [a different long-standing blog](https://www.alexstrick.com)
that I will combine with this one at some point, but for now I intend to post
technical posts here.
