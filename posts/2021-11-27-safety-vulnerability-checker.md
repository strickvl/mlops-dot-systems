title: Check your security vulnerabilities with `safety`
toc: false

[`safety`](https://github.com/pyupio/safety) is a tiny tool that checks your package's dependencies for security vulnerabilities. It is free to use for open-source projects, and using it is as a `pip install safety` followed by `safety check`.

It checks a database of known security vulnerabilities. This database is only updated once every month, but if you are not open-source or you need access to the more frequently-updated database, then you can [subscribe via pyup](https://pyup.io/pricing/).

With that caveat, it's not perfect, but it's better than nothing. An easy CI win for open-source projects.

[I first learned of this tool [here](https://calmcode.io/shorts/safety.py.html). Many thanks to [calmcode](https://calmcode.io/) for continuing to make these really useful videos.]
