    "For the types of machine learning that involve neural networks, the training process generally involves passing data and some weights into a function which we use to continually and iteratively optimise the weights. We hope that by showing lots of examples of the right way to do things (as per our data and annotations) we'll emerge with a model (i.e. the updated weights) that performs the way we'd expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "This whole process has various kinds of mathematics at its core, some basic calculations and some higher-order ideas to help figure out how to improve the weights. For all this, we need our data to be in a form that can pass through these calculations. We're in the domain of natural / human languages at the moment, so we need somehow to turn our words into some kind of numerical form. Tokenisation is a big part of that process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of what goes on with tokenisation is — to some extent — around finding a way to optimise the amount of data we have to feed into our model either during training or inference. We want to do both of these in the most efficient manner possible. Smaller amounts of data needed to train (or faster ways of processing the data) means you can do more with less."

    "## 📚 Linguistically-enhanced tokenization\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get to the current best-in-class solution to this problem, it's worth mentioning that there are some approaches that use some hand-crafted features derived from a linguistic understanding of a particular language.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in deciding which words to leave out of tokenization, we might want to ignore ones which tend not to give so much useful information. For English, these are works like \"the\", \"or\" or \"a\". (You can get a sense of these words [here](https://dedolist.com/lists/language/stop-words-english/).\n",
    "\n",
    "We also might want to use 'stemming' and/or 'lemmatisation' as a way of reducing the total number of words in our vocabulary:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stemming reduces the word to a more basic form, i.e. 'the stem'. So the words \"connection\", \"connected\" and \"connects\" might all reduce down to \"connect\". Note that this stemmed word might not actually exist in English.\n",
    "- Lemmatisation is similar, but it uses a bit of extra knowledge of the language to reduce the words. For example, \"good\", \"better\" and \"best\" might all reduce down to \"good\" even though they are spelled in quite different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both stemming and lemmatisation (as far as I know) and some other related techniques require a pre-existing knowledge base to exist and to have been hand-coded or hard-coded into the software you use to process your text. For some languages that's not a problem, but for Balochi these resources haven't yet been created. A few years back it might even have been the next step for me in my Balochi project to go ahead and work on preparing these kinds of linguistic features and work using these techniques. They require a considerable amount of expertise in the specific language you're working on, and I'm assuming they take a long time to put together as well.\n",

The '##' means that something can join to the letter from that side.
