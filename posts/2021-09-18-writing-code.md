I read [Daniel Roy Greenfeld's post](https://daniel.feldroy.com/posts/code-code-code) on how he found that coding *a lot* was key to improving his skills. It makes sense. Everything I've read so far and my previous experience at the metaskill of learning new things tells me that it is a good investment of time.

Just like you get good at writing by doing a lot of writing, on some level that is true for coding. (Of course, there are additional pieces to the puzzle: you have to develop some taste alongside the pure production side, you have to do some quality-control and refactor your code, and so on and so on.)

For me, this looks like the following:

- coding at work during the week
- smaller focused exercises from [PythonMorsels](https://www.pythonmorsels.com), [Exercism](https://exercism.org), [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) and [AlgoExpert](https://www.algoexpert.io/product)
- code written while working my way through the [fastai course](https://course.fast.ai); this will probably manifest as blog posts here as well, outlining some small project I completed along the way.
- a bigger project, perhaps a package, that I'll start building at some point. I have some ideas for things I want to implement. I'll pick one soon. It'll probably be related in some way to the fastai coding. I'm thinking right now of making a tool that allows you to download PDFs and use the pages of those PDFs as image files in computer vision problems; a data ingestion tool, in other words.
- smaller scripts to solve daily problems in my digital life. I'll store those on [my GitHub](https://github.com/strickvl) somewhere and write up the design decisions around the more interesting ones here.

One thing I took note of was how Daniel mentioned that it made sense to specialise and focus on one language at a time, particularly in the early days. Rather than indulging my curiosity and doing 1001 things using Go or lisp or whatever, I will try to stick to Python at least until I feel more confident with it.
