These lines from a poem written by Shin Gul Aajiz and published on the Taliban's website sometime in late 2007:

> The river of your love took me, I am going
>
> If I am a drop, you are the sun of beauty
>
> I am a garden of flowers because of your love’s spring

It's one of the poems that [Felix](http://www.felixkuehn.com "Felix Kuehn's Blog") and I are editing together for a collection to be published by [Hurst Books](http://www.hurstpub.co.uk/) in early 2011. Lots of different styles, forms and subject matter. The one above is about yearning for his 'beloved'. Many are political (motivational anthems angry with the 'kuffar') but these by no means dominate the collection we've kept since 2006.
