I've been pleasantly surprised by the interest and the number of people who've already pre-ordered copies of my new book, [Master Arabic](http://languagecoach.io/masterarabic). I wrote [a guest blogpost](http://lingualism.com/arabic-blog/master-arabic/) at the end of last week for [Lingualism](http://lingualism.com/bookstore/), a wonderful small publisher that puts out quality materials relating to dialect. If you're studying Egyptian Arabic in particular, they have lots of materials you'll want to check out.

Today, I wanted to say something about the image I chose for the cover of the book. My mother, [Liz Strick](http://www.lizstrick.com/), is a painter and this is one of her recent works entitled *Energy*. She wrote the following about the painting:

*"In 2014 I suffered a severe stroke with partial and permanent paralysis as a result. For an artist this is a tremendous, almost insurmountable, setback! Art took up an essential part of my life up until I suffered the stroke. Art always had a central place in my heart and in my head. After years of continued physiotherapy treatments and rehabilitation, it is hard to explain what happened when I was eventually prompted by my physiotherapist to start using my left paralysed hand for what I had alway loved doing best all my life: art. He gave me back my life and the gift of hope! It is a gift more valuable than I could have thought. Energy started flowing through my body and I had found my own way to overcome the ‘impossible’: drawing with my lame left hand! “Energy” was born and is here to stay." [*[*SOURCE*](http://www.lizstrick.com/en/the-art-of-liz-strick-printed-on-book-cover-of-master-arabic/)*]*

I thought the image was ideal for the cover not only because the lines reminded me of the Arabic script somewhat, but also because the story of the painting - born out of difficulty and determination - should be relatable to any student of the Arabic language. [Check out the rest](http://www.lizstrick.com/) of my mother's paintings here, and if you're in the Netherlands, consider visiting [her open exhibition](http://www.lizstrick.com/en/plan-b-liz-strick-in-home-gallery-exhibition/), running until the end of the month.
