<p><em>[This is part of a series on getting out of a language-learning plateau at the intermediate-advanced level. Check out the other parts here.]</em></p>
<p><img src="images/2021-05-26-arabic-language-plateau-principles/5ca5bbf280bf_image-asset.avif" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Seasoned language learners are familiar with the concept of the ‘language plateau’. If you’re learning a second language for the first time, you will inevitably reach a point in your studies where your progress seems to flatten. You will find this place and period extremely frustrating.</p>
<p>When you are in your plateau, it’s <a href="http://www.lingholic.com/reaching-a-plateau-in-language-learning-how-to-get-out-of-it/">hard to improve</a> because you’re already at a point of (some kind of) self-sufficiency. You can express yourself. You understand most of what is going on in a conversation or TV series you watch. You can write things and people will understand what you’re saying. You could (and many do) stop your studies at this point and still be ‘functional’ in the language.</p>
<p>Getting out of this flat, dead zone is what I want to talk about today. It’s hard, but it’s by no means impossible, and making this kind of progress is possibly the most valuable work you’ll do in your language studies, because all of it will be specifically tailored to your needs.</p>
<p>The starting point, though, is to identify your current status. What can you do? You don’t (necessarily) need to take a formal language certification test to get a grade, though that can sometimes be useful. The kind of measurements you want to take are more subjective. You want to take stock of your capacity in certain situations, what level you are able to achieve in different contexts (your skills in reading will be different from writing vs listening or speaking, for example) and you want also to assess your experience on the cultural level as well – i.e.&nbsp;how much experience do you have navigating all the unspoken parts of culture, whether that is body language, or behaviours and so on.</p>
<section id="principles-of-skill-acquisition" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="principles-of-skill-acquisition">Principles of Skill Acquisition</h2>
<p>Now a slight detour into some more general principles of skill acquisition. Some of this is derived from my own personal experience, other parts from interviews with experts in this field (such as <a href="http://www.sourcesandmethods.com/podcast/2016/6/14/sources-and-methods-27-k-anders-ericsson">my conversation with K. Anders Ericsson</a>, who more or less <em>invented</em>&nbsp;the field of expert performance studies), and other parts still from reading a bunch of books on the subject.</p>
<p>Three things are relevant here:</p>
<section id="stretch" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="stretch">1) Stretch</h3>
<p>When you’re learning a new skill, you want to step outside your comfort zone. This is usually difficult work, and work that is mentally (and possibly emotionally) taxing. Thus, if you want to get better at speaking in Arabic, you’ll need to speak more, but at the beginning this practice (i.e.&nbsp;talking with other people) will feel pretty horrible, simply because you’re not used to doing it. It’s a paradox that you need to do the thing to get better at doing the thing. It is this difficulty, pushing yourself a little past what you’re capable of doing, that allows for personal growth. (<a href="http://www.alexstrick.com/blog/existential-battles-climbing-amman">I wrote about this</a> in an entirely different context a few weeks ago with respect to my attempts to get better at climbing.)</p>
</section>
<section id="lots-of-practice-coupled-with-speedy-feedback" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lots-of-practice-coupled-with-speedy-feedback">2) Lots of practice coupled with speedy feedback</h3>
<p>These two parts (practice and feedback) go together. It isn’t practice alone that will allow you to improve, but rather the combination of making efforts to use new skills alongside getting some kind of feedback that tells you when you’re getting it wrong vs when you’re not. An implication of this, too, is the reality that this kind of practice is going to involve you making lots of mistakes. This can feel crappy, especially when you’re getting immediate feedback on exactly when this is happening. You need to adopt a flexible mindset, if possible, in which you see the mistakes as indicators of growth rather than as any kind of personal or intellectual failures on your part.</p>
</section>
<section id="know-what-youre-practicing-and-focus-on-that" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="know-what-youre-practicing-and-focus-on-that">3) Know what you’re practicing and focus on that</h3>
<p>This is basically Ericsson’s <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3020758/leadership-now/why-deliberate-practice-is-the-only-way-to-keep-getting-better">principle of “deliberate practice”</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Rather than chilling out in the comfort of skills you’ve already acquired, as an expert-to-be, you’re relentless about heading to the frontier of your abilities. The practice shouldn’t be so difficult that it overwhelms you—that would be depressingly demotivating, but not so easy that you’re unconsciously languishing. In other words, you’re arranging for flow, that space where you’re right at the boundary of your abilities.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See also this <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3020758/leadership-now/why-deliberate-practice-is-the-only-way-to-keep-getting-better">summary</a> of the routines that ‘experts’ tend to have around deliberate practice:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>They can only engage in practice without rest for around an hour.<br>
They practice in the morning with a fresh mind.<br>
They practice the same amount every day, including on weekends.<br>
They only have four to five hours of deliberate practice a day.<br>
If they don’t get enough rest, they can get overtraining injuries or burnout.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you’re hoping that ‘using the language’ in a general and non-specific way will get you out of your plateau, you’ll be disappointed. It’s perfectly possible to exist in the plateau zone without improvement <em>ad infinitum</em>. If you want to improve at a certain skill, you’ll need to isolate that element and focus on it in a targeted way. This can be vocabulary, or speaking about a certain topic, or even something as small as ‘using conditional sentences’. Whatever it is, you’ll only get better if you concentrate your efforts.</p>

<section id="customisation-your-individual-needs" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="customisation-your-individual-needs">Customisation &amp; Your Individual Needs</h2>
<p>Learning languages at the post-intermediate level will be a different experience from what you are used to in the early stages. Early on, you’re doing a great deal of necessary-but-boring work to learn basic patterns, vocabulary and grammar.</p>
<p>Once you have mastered that, and you can explain yourself in most basic contexts, you reach the point where you have to customise. There’s a great deal of science and research behind this claim. Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUqME-RTtIs">this talk</a>, by the always stimulating Alexander Arguelles, for an overview of some of that research.</p>
<p>You’ll need to pick which areas you’re most interested in. This is the hard work of advanced language studies – you pick one area or context, conquer it, and then pick another area and repeat. This fulfils the princicle of focus that I mentioned above.</p>
<p>To give an example from my own studies. My current big push for Arabic is to be able to read serious fiction (i.e.&nbsp;short stories and novels written for native speakers). I’ve <a href="http://www.alexstrick.com/blog/2015/9/surviving-middlebury-how-to-get-the-most-out-of-an-arabic-summer-school">written previously</a> that this was a personal goal, but various realities of how modern literature is written really make it hard to take the leap into complex native-reader-level fiction (especially novels). Arab writers like to use many synonyms (for poetic effect, or perhaps as an attempt at pretension?) for words, so when reading I often find myself stuck referring to dictionaries the whole time. Fortunately,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Arabic-Literary-Reader-Students/dp/1138828696/ref=mt_paperback?_encoding=UTF8&amp;me=&amp;tag=soumet-20">a new textbook</a> offering graded literature at just that ‘stretch’ level was released recently, which is allowing me an entry point into that world. None of the texts are simplified, and the language is hard and the number of unknown words is pretty large, but it’s not <em>too</em>&nbsp;far down the scale of difficulty.</p>
</section>
<section id="on-making-a-self-study-plan" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="on-making-a-self-study-plan">On Making a Self-Study Plan</h2>
<p>My next post will cover and offer a host of suggestions for resources you can use to get out of this plateau / dead zone. Before you start reading through and diving into things that seem interesting, I’d strongly advise you take the time to figure out your specific goals. “Improve my Arabic” is not a useful goal. It’s too unspecific. Even “improve my spoken Arabic” may not be particularly useful at the intermediate-advanced level. Once you figure out your goal, write it down somewhere. Maybe stick it to your wall or on the inside of your notebook. It’s good to be reminded why we’re doing the work.</p>
<p>Once you have your goal, then you want to set yourself small targeted bursts or challenges to push out into your stretch zone. You don’t want these challenges to feel like you’re straining against the limits of what you are capable. You want it to be just challenging enough that you feel uncomfortable, but not so much that you are constantly questioning yourself and your abilities in any kind of fundamental sense.</p>
<p>The scale of these challenges will be pretty variable, so examples will span a range of tasks from taking a week to learn and read deeply in a niche topic, to something more longer-term (over six months, perhaps) like my modern literature challenge. The characteristic that you need to look for, however, is that you’ll be able to tell when you’re finished with the challenge. Part of defining the goal is finding a specific (and somewhat measurable) definition of what it means to have achieved what you want.</p>
<p>Then the rest of the trick is basically keeping moving, tracking your progress and achievements along the way. There are various ways of doing this, some of which will depend on what else you have done in this regard. You can add in things like <a href="../blog?tag=beeminder">Beeminder</a> to encourage compliance and regularity, or you can do that in other ways.</p>
<p>When I work with people 1-on-1 to learn a language, a lot of what we do is figuring out this kind of ongoing goal setting and progress assessment. (If you want to learn more about this, <a href="http://www.alexstrick.com/language-coaching">click here and read through what I offer</a>).</p>
<p>The next posts will offer a roadmap to the different resources available to the intermediate student of Arabic and some of the ways you can utilise these resources. It won’t be exhaustive, but I’m pretty sure that most will find something of use in them. Feel free to <a href="https://twitter.com/strickvl">get in touch</a> if you have specific things you want me to tackle in terms of skill development in Arabic.</p>
