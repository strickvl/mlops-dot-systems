If you’re still looking around for last-minute Christmas presents, look no further. How about the friend who has been struggling to learn a language? Know someone who is always talking about how they want to learn a language but don’t have the time? Or even you yourself: are you always putting off studying Arabic or French (or even Mandarin) that you know would benefit you, but you just don’t know how to get started?

I offer custom-made language coaching to suit your schedule and needs. You might need help with motivation, accountability, coming up with a grand plan and/or just require someone to be a sounding post for a study plan you’re already working on.

Whatever you language-learning needs, I’ll be happy to work with you. My goal is to help you reach your goals as directly as possible. We’ll work to your strengths and find ways to make the process less of a chore.
