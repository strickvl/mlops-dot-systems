I’m very glad to be able to announce two new things I’ve been busy with over the past few months.

![](images/2016-05-25-2016-5-memorisation-language-ninja/b1812ec14325_image-asset.avif)

Firstly, I’m [launching an email course](http://incrementalelephant.org/) showing how to learn long lists of items by heart. This course is outwardly directed towards Muslims, since the list that you learn over the course of a week, is a list of 99 Names of God — the so-called [*Asmaa ul-Husnaa*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_God_in_Islam). But the broad principles are the same for learning any long list of things, so don’t think you need to be a Muslim to take the course. The materials come with lots of handouts and supplementary information about memory and the like.

Note that this first course is part of something new I’m calling [*Incremental Elephant*](http://incrementalelephant.org/), a place where I can offer more courses related to memory, language-learning and productivity.

Secondly, as regular readers of this blog will know, I’ve been blogging about technology, productivity, language learning and the intersection between the three for several years. Along the way, I’ve fielded dozens of questions from readers about which programme to use for this or that scenario, or which textbook to use when starting out with language x or y. I’ve increasingly been taking on longer-term clients to coach through these issues, so I’m taking the opportunity now to announce officially that I offer one-on-one coaching for language learning or productivity-related issues.

The language you’re learning doesn’t need to be [one that I already know](http://www.alexstrick.com/languages/), because my coaching is usually targeting the meta-issues of *how* you’re studying rather than *what* you’re studying.

I offer weekly or biweekly Skype coaching sessions. This will include a mix of reviews of work you did the past week, planning your studies for the coming week and brainstorming techniques to get you over specific problems that are preventing you from moving forward. (For example, I’ve recently been working with someone who has problems declining verbs, so we’ve been tackling that from several angles using a variety of techniques).

More news on the Ph.D. front in a few months, I hope, but for now, go check out the [99 Names course](http://incrementalelephant.org/) and [get in touch](http://incrementalelephant.org/contact/) if you would like to discuss working with me to improve how you go about learning languages.

UPDATE: I've written up a more extensive explanation of what one-on-one language coaching involves, and what kinds of problems it's best suited to tackling. Read more [here](http://www.alexstrick.com/language-coaching).
