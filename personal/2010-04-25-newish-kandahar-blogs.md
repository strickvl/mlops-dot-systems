Just a short shout-out to three blogs also posting from Kandahar for those who don't already follow them. Not everything is always interesting, but given the dearth of information they're worth keeping up with.

[Kandahar Diary](http://kandahardiary.wordpress.com/) - PSC Contractor based down in Kandahar, managing operations all over the south it seems.

[Knights of Afghanistan](http://knightsofafghanistan.blogspot.com/) - Observations from an Expat Country Manager for an Afghan PSC, based down in Kandahar

[Free Range International](http://freerangeinternational.com/blog/) - Most of you will already read these guys, but now they're increasingly posting from Kandahar rather than just from Nangarhar.
