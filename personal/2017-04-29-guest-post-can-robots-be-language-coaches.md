I [wrote a guest post](https://learnercoachingelt.wordpress.com/2017/03/17/alex_strick/) over on the [Learner Coaching ELT](https://learnercoachingelt.wordpress.com/) blog:

> I read [From English Teacher to Learner Coach](https://www.amazon.com/English-Teacher-Learner-Coach-practising-ebook/dp/B00J52LY0Y/ref=sr_1_1_twi_kin_1?sr=8-1&ie=UTF8&keywords=learner%2Bcoach&tag=soumet-20&qid=1488804790) only recently. I received a glowing recommendation from a fellow language coach, [Lýdia Machová](http://www.languagementoring.com/), and the more I read, the more enthusiastic I became. The methods described in the book mesh pretty well with those I developed through my own studies of various languages. This was an approach suited not only to those learning English, but rather something that could (and should!) be adopted by the thousands of native English-speakers who struggle to learn a second language each year.

> Indeed, the general message of the book – one I interpreted as ‘we don’t have to wait to be taught; we can learn for ourselves’ – is something that I believe has important implications for how we go about education in the coming decades. (I was especially pleased to learn a new word – heutagogy – for this somewhat hard-to-define practice of self-education). Seth Godin [has written about](http://www.sethgodin.com/sg/docs/StopStealingDreamsSCREEN.pdf) the demise of the system of factory education and others are tackling this from various angles.
