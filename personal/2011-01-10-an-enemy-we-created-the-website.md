You can read more about *An Enemy We Created* on the book's [website](http://www.anenemywecreated.com/). It went online tonight and contains an outline of the argument along with advance praise from several analysts and scholars of the region. This is the book [Felix Kuehn](http://www.felixkuehn.com) and I spent the past year working on.  Go take a look:
