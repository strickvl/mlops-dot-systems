An article I wrote for [*Himal Magazine*](http://himalmag.com/) back in 2014 [has just been released](http://himalmag.com/reading-the-taliban/?currentPage=all) on their website in a digital format. It’s a bit dated, and there have since been a number of significant developments in terms of the [availability of primary sources](https://www.alexstrick.com/blog/2015/12/reading-the-afghan-taliban-67-sources-you-should-be-studying), but I wouldn’t change the overall shape of the argument. The nub of what I tried to say was this:

> *“These sources allow for a far fuller and rounded portrayal of the Taliban, both as individuals and as a movement. It is only through understanding the viewpoints of those in senior leadership positions – as expressed in statements, poems or internal memos – that one can arrive at an understanding of why certain decisions were taken, and get more of a sense of the Taliban’s social identity. It is not enough to view the Taliban through an Islamist lens, or a Pashtun lens for that matter. From the 1980s onwards, the Taliban’s identity was subject to change, with different groups and individuals following different paths in the ever-changing environment the movement found itself in. These processes continued after 9/11, and a nuanced and detailed understanding of the evolution of the Taliban and their identity will prove to be a valuable and instructive exercise.”*

This also happens to be the justification for my current work finishing up [The Taliban Reader](http://www.hurstpublishers.com/book/the-taliban-reader/), a sourcebook and reference tool which will hit bookshelves in the spring.
