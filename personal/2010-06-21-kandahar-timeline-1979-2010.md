Many of you have already downloaded and visited my [previous post](/a-different-place/2010/04/kandahar-chronology-september-2001-october-2009) which contained a PDF version of a chronology of events in Kandahar from September 2001 up to the present day. For various other projects in the past (most of all, for work in connection with Mullah Zaeef's *[My Life With the Taliban](http://www.mylifewiththetaliban.com/ "My Life With the Taliban")*) I have found it useful to put together event data of varying levels of granularity.

Various projects made it difficult for me to work on compiling these various chronologies and event lists, but I finally found time to finish it off this week. Accordingly, please visit [http://www.alexstrick.com/timeline/](http://static.squarespace.com/static/544a27a7e4b042df02dea00c/544a2abfe4b017ad0e2a476a/544a2adde4b017ad0e2a4e34/1414146781178/?format=original) for a more or less complete listing of events that took place in or relating to Kandahar from 1979-2010. Some years are less thoroughly presented than others, but this will change as I incrementally update the timeline over the next few months as I simultaneously go through the final stages of editing (together with [Felix Kuehn](http://www.felixkuehn.com "Felix Kuehn's Blog")) Mullah Zaeef's second and forthcoming book.

I hope, also, to be able to find time to explain how I put the raw data together and was able to present it in this format. In short, I used an extremely nifty piece of software called [Tinderbox](http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/ "Tinderbox") (Mac only, apologies...) and was given a lot of help by some people who understand its ins and outs far better than I currently do. So special thanks to [Mark Anderson](http://www.shoantel.com/) for that, and to [Mark Bernstein](http://www.markbernstein.org/) for writing the software in the first place. I use Tinderbox for almost all of my work these days (data gathering, data sorting, data organisation... the list goes on) and strongly recommend others with high-volume complex data projects to give it a try.

Anyway, find the timeline [here](http://static.squarespace.com/static/544a27a7e4b042df02dea00c/544a2abfe4b017ad0e2a476a/544a2adde4b017ad0e2a4e34/1414146781178/?format=original) and please don't hesitate to get in touch with comments/corrections.
