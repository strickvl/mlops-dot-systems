Just a short post. Two reports that I co-authored have just been published. They were both finished a few months back, but they're not so time-sensitive that this will make much of a difference.

The first is for Chatham House, written together with [Felix Kuehn](http://www.felixkuehn.com "Felix Kuehn (blog)"). You can [read the executive summary here](http://www.chathamhouse.org/publication/rebooting-political-settlement-engagement-and-mediation-after-afghan-elections), and [download the full report here](http://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/files/chathamhouse/field/field_document/20140728Afghanistan.pdf). The central point we were trying to get across is that a political settlement in Afghanistan must be about more than just 'talks with the Taliban'. That ship has sailed, and new realities mean it's important to bring all parties into a discussion about the future. I remain skeptical as to internal and external parties' ability to make this happen, but here's hoping...

The second report, much longer, was mainly an effort of [Felix Kuehn](http://www.felixkuehn.com) and [Leah Farrall](http://allthingscounterterrorism.com/) but I contributed some things on the sidelines. This was expert witness testimony in the case of US vs. Talha Ahsan and US vs. Babar Ahmad. You can read some of the background to the case [here](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jul/23/outsourcing-terror-cases-us-trial-uk-government-talha-ahsan-babar-ahmad) and [here](https://news.vice.com/article/family-of-the-terrorist-that-wasnt-prepares-for-his-return-from-us). The report we were tasked with writing related to Talha and Babar's activities in Afghanistan during the 1990s, and the extent to which this equated with support for or 'membership' in al-Qaeda. Felix and I have [already written a decent amount](http://www.anenemywecreated.com/) on the topic, but it was great to team up with Leah to dive into the foreign fighters' side a great deal more.

You can [read our report here](http://www.sacc.org.uk/sacc/docs/ba_expert_reports.pdf), starting on page 148. It's a long report, but there's a lot of new material in there which has never been published (as far as I'm aware).

I'd also recommend reading through ~~the [judge's statement](http://www.sacc.org.uk/sacc/docs/ta_sentencing.pdf)~~ [Talha's sentencing memo](http://www.sacc.org.uk/sacc/docs/ta_sentencing.pdf). I don't quite understand why there hasn't been more media coverage of this trial, and how the government were more or less told their case was extremely rickety. Perhaps it's because of all the other things going on at the moment.

UPDATE: Edited on August 11 to reflect error in identifying the sentencing memo.
