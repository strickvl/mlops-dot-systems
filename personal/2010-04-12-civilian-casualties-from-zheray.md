Heard this morning about a bus travelling on the Herat-Kandahar road which was shot up by NATO troops. Above you can hear one of the victims explaining what happened. He seems to be the only one in the Mirwais Hospital in Kandahar City; the rest were taken to the main base at Kandahar Airfield (KAF).  
A couple of pictures follow:
