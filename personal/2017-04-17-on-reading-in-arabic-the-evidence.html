<p><em>[This is the second post in a series on the importance of reading when studying Arabic (or any other language). Read the* <a href="https://www.alexstrick.com/blog/arabic-reading-importance-part1"><em>first post</em></a> *here.]</em></p>
<p>It is notoriously difficult to study and show which are the most efficient methods to study second languages. For starters, everyone is slightly different, so it’s hard to compare between individuals. Learning a language is also such an involved pursuit (taking place over all hours of the day, and in the mind, where microscope or dictaphone can’t usefully reach) that it is impractical to follow the student for all twenty-four hours of the day.</p>
<p>Having given the pitch for why I think reading is so important for students of Arabic, today I wanted to summarise a study that was carried out from 1970-1977. This study, by ElSaid Badawi, is entitled “In the quest for the Level 4+ in Arabic: training Level 2–3 learners in independent reading” and can be found as an article in Betty Lou Leaver and Boris Shekhtman’s fascinating (and underrated / underred) edited volume, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Developing-Professional-Level-Language-Proficiency-Leaver/dp/0521016851/ref=sr_1_1?sr=8-1&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=Developing%2BProfessional-Level%2BLanguage%2BProficiency&amp;tag=soumet-20&amp;qid=1492243100"><em>Developing Professional-Level Language Proficiency</em></a>. Given its somewhat obscure provenance, it’s unlikely you’d come across this fascinating article in the normal course of your day, hence my interest in summarising it for you here.</p>
<p>Badawi offers an overview of his experience running the <a href="http://casa.fas.harvard.edu/">CASA (Center for Arabic Study Abroad)</a> programme between 1970-1977. This programme was originally started in 1967 for advanced-level students and the idea of it was to give a year of intensive study in order to really catapult students into real competency in being able to read, speak and use Arabic in a professional capacity. (Badawi begins his article with a justification for reading, but I’ll skip those details since their is a great deal of overlap with what I’ve already written).</p>
<p>The original CASA curriculum in the 1967-era programme was established around a 3000-word vocabulary list, reading of some short passages using those words in context, a grammar book and two long ‘authentic’ texts that would be covered over the course of the year. The students found this dull and unrewarding, however, so CASA’s administrators decided to design a new course based around familiarising students with a ‘language domain of their interests’. In other words: allowing them to read things that were related to their interests and professional trajectory.</p>
<p>Students taking part in the programme were assessed (prior to joining) as being at a high level, but their vocabulary was generally limited to political subjects. They had a poor understanding of morphology and little to no facility with semantics. They had, Badawi writes, bad reading habits in Arabic: too much focus on sentence structure, engaged in ‘parsing-based reading’ and with only a minimal grasp of the “semantic role of punctuation”. In that last case, this is the way Arabic uses words, phrasing and sentence constructions to signify the meaning of a sentence, whereas in English a lot of those meaning structures are conveyed through punctuation. Most of all, students suffered from an ‘excessive / crippling’ use of the Arabic-English dictionary, which was identified as an obstacle to spontaneous and contextualised language learning; words were quickly forgotten.</p>
<p>The programme sought to encourage a switch in its students: “a change of attitude toward Arabic from that of a language they are being taught to one which they should start learning”. The responsibility, at this level, generally should switch from the teacher to the students.</p>
<p>The programme was split up into three semesters / terms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Semester 1: 8-week summer programme</li>
</ul>
<p>This was made up of introductory cultural classes (based around Cairo, Egypt, where students were living. It offered classes to bring students up to a competent level in functional colloquial Arabic. (Students could solve all their problems and interact with Egyptians in a functional way, following the course). There was also a component of media Arabic where students would become familiar with the formalised language used in printed and spoken contexts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Semester 2: 14-week autumn programme</li>
</ul>
<p>This semester was for allowing students to gain a higher competence in MSA. Reading was one of the core elements here (news reading became effortless and there was some inclusion of classical language as well). Colloquial Arabic was encouraged through the reading of plays (which often used colloquial/dialect expressions and language). An intensive reading programme was added alongside this to boost confidence.</p>
<ul>
<li>Semester 3: 14-week spring programme</li>
</ul>
<p>The final semester included three graduate-level courses in subjects of the students’ interest / choice. There was also some training in ‘Educated Spoken Arabic’ (i.e.&nbsp;the discussion of high-culture topics).</p>
<p><strong>The Intensive Reading Course</strong></p>
<p>The core belief behind the programme was that reading was important to the students’ knowledge of Arabic in a fundamental way. All the other skills would benefit and develop alongside the reading done as part of the programme. There were different kinds of texts available and a selection criteria for what kinds of reading took place:</p>
<p><img src="images/2017-04-17-on-reading-in-arabic-the-evidence/c8e9fd711285_image-asset.avif" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Finding materials for intensive / analytic reading was easy. The harder issue was finding materials suitable for extensive reading, i.e.&nbsp;the kind of wide-reading that students are able to do with some level of ease. Arabic poses a particular problem in this regard, given its ‘wide range of active vocabulary in use’, and the ‘complexity of the morphs-semantic system’.</p>
<p>Plays were believed to be the best for extensive reading. They carried a “high degree of word and sentence redundancy”, usually had only a single theme and were of moderate length. (It was found that reading two 200-page books was much more satisfying than reading a single 400-page book). Plays also lend themselves to real-life activities. There is also the possibility of watching the plays being performed (or, now, on YouTube).</p>
<p>Novels were also considered useful, but the fact that dialogue is used only minimally means that they were kept for later in the semester. Short stories were denser in meaning and language use and thus harder. They were included in the programme, though, for the sake of variety.</p>
<p>Overall, texts were chosen for the language structures used rather than for their literary value / content.</p>
<p><strong>Reading Texts</strong></p>
<p>The course had students reading three items each week. Usually one novel or a play (a long item) and a short story and a 1-act play (i.e.&nbsp;two short items). These were generally from the same author, and difficulty would escalate over time. All texts were authentic and unabridged. Ideally they were selected from leading literary figures and they would all be texts for which no English translations already exist. Selecting these texts was hard at the beginning, but over the years they settled into a broad pattern, escalating in difficulty:</p>
<ul>
<li>Group 1 (first three weeks)</li>
</ul>
<p>Plays by Tawfiq al-Hakim (short and long). These were good because he uses a lot of redundant vocabulary, follow familiar thematic sources to those with which students would have been familiar, used a lively dialogue and generally contained “straightforward language”.</p>
<ul>
<li>Group 2 (5 weeks)</li>
</ul>
<p>This consisted of works by Ihsan Abdul Quddus, a journalist, novelist and short story writer. These works tackled themes from social phenomena and thus were appropriate to a young audience. They referenced local customs and expressions. They included fewer dialogues in the novels and short stories. They had a lucid structure and controlled range of vocabulary.</p>
<ul>
<li>Group 3</li>
</ul>
<p>This was works by Yusuf Idris, blending MSA with colloquial idioms, Qur’anic citations and quotations from the hadith literature. These were at a higher difficulty level.</p>
<ul>
<li>Group 4</li>
</ul>
<p>This was a mix of items chosen for special topical interest or artistic value. For example, in the final week, students read Fathy Ghanem’s 1958 novel <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6413823"><em>Al-Gabal</em></a>. They also tackled some of the non-famous novels by Nagib Mahfouz.</p>
<p>Mixed in these various groups were shorter items: one-act plays and short stories. There was generally a balance between length of a text and its linguistic difficulty.</p>
<p><strong>Reading Instructions</strong></p>
<p>I found this section of the article the most interesting / instructive. Students were told the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The beginning of a story / text is always the hardest. You don’t know what’s going on, who the characters are and what the context / scene is. Bear with it. A lot of this will be scene-setting. You can always return back to it later on.</li>
<li>Arabic has a lot of redundancy. Compare what you are stuck on with what follows and check if you can figure out the meaning that way.</li>
<li>Continue reading as long as you can make out a story or theme for yourself. Don’t worry or second-guess yourself as to whether what <em>you</em> understand from the story is the same thing as what the author intended you to understand.</li>
<li>If you find a word or part of the structure you don’t understand and stop, DON’T look the word up in the dictionary unless:
<ul>
<li>you have failed to guess the meaning</li>
<li>there is nobody around to ask the meaning</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Mark / highlight the words you were able to guess in the text. Mark the words you were able to do without understanding.</li>
<li>Make a list of cultural features that you’d like to be addressed in class.</li>
<li>Mark and make a list of any expressions and grammatical features or constructions that you want addressed in class.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Classes</strong></p>
<p>Class sessions were essentially there to ensure that students were keeping up with the reading volume. Students would narrate their understanding of the texts they had read, and would raise any issues they wanted to learn more about.</p>
<p>Classes were also a good time to increase students’ semantic understanding – allowing students to identify shared roots and usages in different contexts and forums.</p>
<p>Students submitted written responses / follow-ups to the text in the class with the teacher present. A weekly conference with students gathered feedback on the choices of texts, allowing teachers to adapt the programme depending on the ease/difficulty perceived by each individual cohort of students.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong></p>
<p>By the end of the 14-week programme, students had read an average of 2500 pages of authentic Arabic texts. Graded text levels showed that their language was improving. They were encouraged by managing to review words and structures that had been marked as ‘hard’ earlier on in the semester. (Usually 25-40% of these words had become intelligible to them, despite no vocabulary learning strategy specifically targeted at learning these words.) The graduate-level courses (all taught in Arabic, obviously) of the final semester were also a proving ground for students.</p>
<p>This reading programme increase students’ competence and was transferrable to their other skills. (Yes, even their spoken Arabic.) Reading helped with writing. Reading ‘complete texts’ did a lot for the morale of the students at the intermediate-level, too. And the literary focus of the content was useful for students even if their interests didn’t lie in that particular area.</p>
<p>My next post about reading Arabic will detail some options that are available to the intermediate-level student of Arabic, and some practical considerations resulting from this article.</p>
