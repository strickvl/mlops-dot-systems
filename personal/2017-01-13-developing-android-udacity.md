I was lucky to be awarded a scholarship to learn to code apps for Android phones. [10,000 such scholarships](https://www.udacity.com/google-scholarships) were awarded (from 70,000 applicants) to citizens of the European Union through a Google-Udacity partnership.

If you'd have asked me a few months ago whether I had an interest in learning to code apps for the Android platform (and learning the requisite Java code) I probably would have said it was low on my priority list. This scholarship allows me to learn the basics over the coming three months (with a possible extension of another three months as part of [the full Udacity fasttrack nano degree](https://www.udacity.com/course/associate-android-developer-fast-track--nd818), however, so I will certainly take the time and make use of the opportunity.

It isn't clear to me how far the course will take me, but I'm already thinking that this might be a really great opportunity to develop a version of [my CoachBot language-learning tool](http://languagecoach.io/coachbot) for Android, hopefully one that doesn't require users to be online to use it.

The course so far has been fun. As usual, Udacity's platform and teaching style is highly interactive, iterates over problems and gets you solving practice questions from the start. As a language, Java is different from the Python and Javascript that I've encountered thus far, though I'm not deep enough into the weeds to have a strong appreciation of exactly how.

In any case, watch this space. If you're an Android user and would be interested in an app version of the CoachBot tool, [drop me an email](https://incrementalelephant.org/contact) to let me know.
