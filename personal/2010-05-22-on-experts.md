I found this nice little story about John Cooley:

> In his typical self-effacing manner, [John] Cooley prefaced Payback by recounting how Joe Alex Morris, a friend killed during the first stages of the Iranian revolution while reporting for the Los Angeles Times, cautioned him about taking his expertise too seriously.
>
> "Never consider yourself an expert on the Middle East. If you do, you're already in deep trouble," Morris told Cooley.
