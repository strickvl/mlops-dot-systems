![Poetry of the Taliban - Cover](images/2012-12-22-catching-up-poetry-of-the-taliban/5c14b93b776a_pott-blog.avif)
The second book that came out this year -- I co-edited it together with [Felix Kuehn](http://www.felixkuehn.com) -- was *Poetry of the Taliban*. Some people [weren't entirely happy](http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/may/04/taliban-poetry-book-denounced-british?mobile-redirect=false) with that idea, but on the whole [the reviews](https://pinboard.in/u:strickvl/bundle:TalibanPoetry/) were pretty positive, both about the collection and about the idea of publishing these translated songs.

The very existence of these cultural artefacts provoked a discussion -- ultimately one of the things we had hoped would happen -- and if you browse through [the list of responses](https://pinboard.in/u:strickvl/bundle:TalibanPoetry/) you can get a sense of the diversity of that debate.

If you haven't managed to get hold of a copy, it should be available in most good bookshops (or on online retailers).

(Hint: this would make an excellent Christmas stocking filler.)
