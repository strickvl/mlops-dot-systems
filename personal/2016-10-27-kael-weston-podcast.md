[Matt](http://www.matttrevithick.com/) and I put out [a new episode](http://www.sourcesandmethods.com/podcast/sources-and-methods-31-kael-weston) of [Sources and Methods](http://www.sourcesandmethods.com/) podcast today. We spoke to Kael Weston, discussing his time spent living in Fallujah, the importance of speaking the language of the place in which you work, as well as the political systems countries like the USA employ in far-off places like Iraq and Afghanistan. He also recently wrote a book, [The Mirror Test](https://www.amazon.com/Mirror-Test-America-Iraq-Afghanistan-ebook/dp/B014NZ93GY/ref=sr_1_1_twi_kin_2?sr=8-1&ie=UTF8&keywords=kael%2Bweston&tag=soumet-20&qid=1477597878), which is worth reading. You can find the episode over on iTunes or [listen directly on the Sources and Methods website](http://www.sourcesandmethods.com/podcast/sources-and-methods-31-kael-weston).
