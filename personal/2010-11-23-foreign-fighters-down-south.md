Not so much. Last weekend's Sunday Times carried [an article by Miles Amoore](http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/world_news/Afghanistan/article455120.ece) headlined, "Love drives repentant Taliban chief to defect." It also includes the following:

> Many fighters are thought to have mixed feelings about leaving [the Taliban]. "If I stop fighting, maybe the government will still persecute me as a Talib while the Taliban try to kill me," said Rahman. "I am stuck in the middle." The greater number of foreign fighters in the south and southeast -- mainly from Pakistan and the Middle East -- will make it even harder for foot soldiers there to defect.

I'd like to see some numbers on how many 'foreign fighters' -- "greater" in number -- there supposedly are down in southeastern Afghanistan, let alone in the south. Needless to say this is an exaggerated claim. Watch this space for more detail.
