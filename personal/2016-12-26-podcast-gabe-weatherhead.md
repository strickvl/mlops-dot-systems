I’ve been on a bit of a DevonThink kick these past weeks, and the catalyst for all of this was a conversation I had with [Gabe Weatherhead](http://www.macdrifter.com/) ([@macdrifter](https://twitter.com/macdrifter) over on Twitter, though that account is no longer active).

You can [listen to the full episode](https://www.sourcesandmethods.com/podcast/33-gabe-weatherhead) on your podcast player of choice or over on the Sources and Methods site. Towards the end of the episode we get into the weeds on how he uses [DevonThink Pro Office](http://www.devontechnologies.com/products/devonthink/overview.html) and several other pieces of software. I’m looking forward to hearing Gabe’s much-anticipated appearance on MacPowerUsers in January, since I imagine he’ll go into even more detail there.

We also discussed social media and some of the ways he found himself drifting away from commonly-used sites like Facebook and Twitter. For me, this was the most interesting part of the podcast.
