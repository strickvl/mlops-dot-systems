I visited [the bumper Vermeer exhibition](https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/whats-on/exhibitions/vermeer) today in Amsterdam. I had previously seen many of the works separately in different galleries in the USA and here in the Netherlands, but there's certainly a raw power to bringing them all together in the same space.

Above all, it was the still city landscapes from Delft that left the biggest impression. These small scenes captured so much and seemed to pull you in as if weighted down from within.

I'm glad I managed to get tickets to the exhibition, but will enjoy revisiting the two Delft paintings when they return to the Hague later in the year.
