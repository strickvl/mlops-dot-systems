Steven Johnson, the author of the fantastic book [Where Good Ideas Come From](https://www.amazon.com/Where-Good-Ideas-Steven-Johnson-ebook/dp/B003ZK58TA/ref=sr_1_4_twi_kin_2?sr=8-4&ie=UTF8&keywords=steven%2Bjohnson&tag=soumet-20&qid=1478951672), has been releasing podcasts episodes in advance of the publication of a new book. [Wonderland: How Play Made the Modern World](https://www.amazon.com/Wonderland-Play-Made-Modern-World-ebook/dp/B01CZCW2PQ/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?qid=&sr=&tag=soumet-20&_encoding=UTF8) seems to cover the relationship between innovation and 'play', ideas he has worked to explore in previous books. The [podcast series](https://soundcloud.com/wonderland-podcast) offers a preview of these ideas, engagingly produced and narrated through a series of vignettes and smaller stories.

Episode 3 ("Strange Loops and Circuit Benders (Or, How New Music Comes from Broken Machines)") was an exploration of sound, how our sound universe has been changing alongside technological developments and cultural evolution. Johnson talks to Alex Ross (of [The Rest is Noise](https://www.amazon.com/Rest-Noise-Listening-Twentieth-Century-ebook/dp/B000UZQIDI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&sr=1-1&s=digital-text&keywords=the%2Brest%2Bis%2Bnoise&tag=soumet-20&qid=1478952080) fame) about how new sounds started to enter into the sonic vocabulary of musicians and creators. The other episodes are interesting, too. If you're interested in music and/or technology, you might want to check this one out.
