"The storm is coming. Believe you me. The storm is coming. I try telling people, but it seems they're all just making themselves busy with fixing the leaky roof or the squeaky door. The storm will destroy their entire house and city, though. The storm is coming. You have two options: get out now, or climb down into your bunker and hope that the storm will pass and that you're still alive six months from now. The storm is coming." *(Businessman in Kandahar City)*.
