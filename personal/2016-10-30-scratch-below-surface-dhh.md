I’m part-way through [listening to a podcast interview](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2016/10/27/david-heinemeier-hansson/) with David “DHH” Heinemeier Hansson, creator of [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), author of [Rework](https://www.amazon.com/Rework-Jason-Fried-ebook/dp/B002MUAJ2A/ref=la_B001JS19Y8_1_1?ie=UTF8&sr=1-1&s=books&tag=soumet-20&qid=1477844556) and [Remote](https://www.amazon.com/Remote-Office-Required-Jason-Fried-ebook/dp/B00C0ALZ0W/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&sr=1-1&s=digital-text&keywords=remote&tag=soumet-20&qid=1477844551) and co-founder of [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/). I wanted to write down some brief notes on what came up so far before I forget. I may return to this thread after I’ve finished listening to the rest. These are just some of the points that stood out for me from the conversation; I’d strongly recommend you [give it a listen](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2016/10/27/david-heinemeier-hansson/) yourself, especially if you’re interested in coding, systems thinking, improving and learning new skills and so on.

- Curiosity — this is a skill worth cultivating. There are various metaphors often used for curiosity, but in the podcast DHH talks about the need to ‘dig / scratch below the surface’. He talks about how finding the thing in the topic / skill / domain that interests him is often a case of just keeping burrowing down until you find it.
- Learn What You Need — DHH talks about learning to code as a way of solving a particular problem, and about *learning only just enough* rather than diving into that learning as a pure pursuit needing you to learn *everything*.
- Systems Improvement — this isn’t explored that deeply in the part I listened, but it was a good reminder that there is a way of thinking about improvement that sees improving the system as the way to improve the skill.
- Time / Flow — DHH talks about driving racing cars and how time really flies when he does this. This is an observation that this, for him, is a skill he is enjoying learning, and one that gives him a great sense of that satisfaction that comes from doing a rewarding activity at just the right level of difficulty.

More on this to follow (maybe).
