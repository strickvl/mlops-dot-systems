This week I fell back in love with a piece of software ([DevonThink Pro Office](http://www.devontechnologies.com/products/devonthink/devonthink-pro-office.html)) while reorganising and refreshing two dozen archival databases. I’ve been busy putting the final touches on [The Taliban Reader](http://www.hurstpublishers.com/book/the-taliban-reader/) and I’ve made new strides of progress on the slackline.

## Articles

- Lina Mounzer - “[War in Translation: Giving Voice to  
  the Women of Syria](http://lithub.com/war-in-translation-giving-voice-to-the-women-of-syria/)” (Lithub)

A deeply affecting account of the author’s work as a translator of stories from Syria, how language mediates and obfuscates the terrifying realities of daily life, and how even translation and re-communication gives rise to secondary trauma of a kind. If you read nothing else this week, make it this article.

- Hamzah Nassif - “[Understanding Amman’s Yellow Taxi Dilemma: a Different Take on the Government’s Ongoing Battle With Ride-Hailing Apps](http://black-iris.com/2016/10/11/understanding-ammans-yellow-taxi-dilemma/)” (The Black Iris)

[I wrote about Amman’s taxis](https://tinyletter.com/alexinarabic/letters/message-3) in my Arabic-language newsletter, and this (slightly old) piece helps answer some of my questions as to why taxi drivers in Jordan’s capital behave as they do. It also makes a strong case for changing the status quo. Taxi drivers seem barely able to make a living under current circumstances, and passengers aren’t getting much of a service.

- David Meyer - “[The dark side of .io: How the U.K. is making web domain profits from a shady Cold War land deal](https://gigaom.com/2014/06/30/the-dark-side-of-io-how-the-u-k-is-making-web-domain-profits-from-a-shady-cold-war-land-deal/)” (Gigaom)

As someone who has just bought a couple of new .io domains, I was unsettled to learn the backstory, how something dating back to the early nineteenth century’s colonial expansion (in this case, to the [Chagos islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chagos_Archipelago)) has a direct descendent in the modern age. I’m most likely not going to return the domains I bought, but I probably won’t buy anything new from the .io set.

- Andrew Ng - “[What Artificial Intelligence Can and Can’t Do Right Now](https://hbr.org/2016/11/what-artificial-intelligence-can-and-cant-do-right-now)” (Harvard Business Review)

There’s nothing especially new in this overview piece by one of the leaders in the field of artificial intelligence, both in terms of [innovation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Ng) and [education](https://www.coursera.org/about/leadership). But it’s nevertheless a useful summary of some of the unique features of AI and machine learning, as well as some of the things it is less good at.

- Richard Benton - “[Language hacking ≠ language love](https://lovinglanguage.wordpress.com/2016/09/26/language-hacking-%E2%89%A0-language-love/)” (Loving Languages)

Richard’s posts are excellent at returning us to the reasons why it’s worth learning languages — to connect, to be useful perhaps, and not to simply chalk up notches on one’s belt. This recent posts is a challenge to the thankfully-less-omnipresent online polyglot community. Recommended if you’ve ever studied more than one second-language.

## Books

This week, I reread [Rework](https://www.amazon.com/Rework-Jason-Fried-ebook/dp/B002MUAJ2A/ref=sr_1_1_twi_kin_2?sr=8-1&ie=UTF8&keywords=rework&tag=soumet-20&qid=1480617689) by Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson. Looking into my Goodreads list, I noted that I gave it a two-star rating when I first read it a few years back. Now, perhaps I was in a better place to absorb some of the lessons, but I gave it four stars. I’ll be writing a longer review for the blog here of some of the more contrarian or unexpected lessons. I’m currently reading Rebecca Solnit’s [Men Explain Things to Me](https://www.amazon.com/Men-Explain-Things-Rebecca-Solnit-ebook/dp/B00IWGQ8PU/ref=sr_1_1_twi_kin_2?sr=8-1&ie=UTF8&keywords=men%2Bexplain%2Bthings&tag=soumet-20&qid=1480622707) alongside Mark Manson’s [The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fck\*](https://www.amazon.com/Subtle-Art-Not-Giving-Counterintuitive-ebook/dp/B019MMUA8S/ref=sr_1_1_twi_kin_2?sr=8-1&ie=UTF8&keywords=subtle%2Bart%2Bnot%2Bgiving%2Bfuck&tag=soumet-20&qid=1480703383) (as audiobook).

## Films / TV

I’m working my way through [Channel 4’s Humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humans_(TV_series)), albeit painfully slowly. It was recommended on a recent podcast as a possible vision for what a future with humanoid AI machines might look like: not as different as we might imagine, but still different enough to provoke some real societal challenges.
