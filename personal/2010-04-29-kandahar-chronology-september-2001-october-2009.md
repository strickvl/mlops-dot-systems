I compiled this chronology of significant events relating to Kandahar province last year. The primary source for these dates/events was the New York Times' archive, but then (almost) everything has been double-sourced. Everything from about 2008 onwards was while I was here in Kandahar so that then is my own observations and event listings. Perhaps someone will find it useful and it will save someone somewhere some time.

Here is the file:
