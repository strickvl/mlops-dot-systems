Episode one of Sources and Methods’s new season is [out today](https://www.sourcesandmethods.com/podcast/38-rightlobemath). In this interview, Matt and I spoke with the two creators of an online programme to teach the abacus.

I’ve been studying the abacus over the past few months using [the RightLobeMath course](https://www.rightlobemath.com/) and can attest to how thoroughly they build up the skill progressions. Using the web app doesn’t always feel completely polished as an experience, but it’s clear that a lot of thought has gone into the pedagogy. I’m extremely glad that it even exists at all as a service!

The rest of the season has all been recorded and edited and will be released at regular intervals. We got to talk to some amazing guests, some of whom are personal heroes / inspirations of mine from the world of technology. For now, though, you can find the first episode [here](https://www.sourcesandmethods.com/podcast/38-rightlobemath).
