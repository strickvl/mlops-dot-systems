I read a decent amount of tech media/press. Barely a day goes by when there isn't someone in my [RSS feed](https://www.newsblur.com/) explaining how they dropped application X for application Y. This seems to happen most often for frequently-used applications or workflows like scheduling/calendars or email.

I won't call out the specific blog post that set me writing this post, but suffice it to say that I wish there was a clause (in the contract of life) forcing tech writers or bloggers to state why the application they're singing the praises of is better than the one they were using up to now. Specifically, are there any new features, or does it just look shinier? Also, have you been using it for longer than a day or two?

I'm pretty solid and stable in the applications I use. It'll take something pretty seismic to rid me of [DevonThink](http://devontechnologies.com/products/devonthink/overview.html) or [Tinderbox](http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/) or [Mailmate](https://freron.com/). But if you catch me flip-flopping in my tech-related writing, please call me out on it.
