I [haven’t written much](https://www.alexstrick.com/blog/2016/5/memorisation-language-ninja) on this blog about [the memory course](http://incrementalelephant.org/) I wrote and launched a few months back. Its target audience is Muslims hoping to learn the non-canonical *Asmaa al-Husnaa* or 99 Names of God.

The point of the course isn’t so much to learn the 99 Names. They have their uses, to be sure, but I chose them mainly as a proxy to teach some basic memory techniques and skills that will have relevance and use throughout your life.

The course of emails lasts for a week, but as part of the package you get:

- daily emails containing the course’s core lessons
- 13 custom worksheets and handouts to practice the daily email lessons
- a summary sheet at the end of the week with an overview of the main principles of the course
- recommendations for ways to apply the principles in your daily lives and in other studies
- support through the Incremental Elephant community on the forum

I haven’t done that much marketing or outreach except what has been easily to hand, but I’ve been pleasantly surprised by the numbers of users trickling in bit by bit. Some recent feedback from users:

> *“Thank you for setting up this helpful course! It's been fascinating to learn the memory techniques and tips you've offered.”*

*D.N., Singapore*

> *“Overall, I'm quite pleased that this course gave me the incentive to memorise the names properly and I also learnt other interesting things (can see now how this could easily become an obsession!). The emails were readable and contained about the right amount of information to make it doable in one week. Your didn't make any grandiose claims and the price was very reasonable. Jazakallahu kheyra. I'll recommend this to others.”R.H., United Kingdom*

I’ve also been pleased how those who finish the course have gone on to develop interests in more advanced memory techniques beyond the foundations contained in the email lessons.

If you’ve ever been interested in having a better memory, being able to learn longer lists and complex ideas for school or daily life, head on over to [*Incremental Elephant*](http://incrementalelephant.org/) and [give it a try](http://incrementalelephant.org/)!
