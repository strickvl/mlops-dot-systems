[Gabe Wyner](http://www.fluent-forever.com/) has [a book](http://www.amazon.com/Fluent-Forever-Learn-Language-Forget-ebook/dp/B00IBZ405W/ref=dp_kinw_strp_1) out today, and I took the time to interview him about his method. It relies on several things I've [mentioned](https://alex-strickvanlinschoten-rc2y.squarespace.com/a-different-place/2013/01/5-things-i-wish-someone-had-told-me-about-learning-languages) on this blog [before](https://alex-strickvanlinschoten-rc2y.squarespace.com/a-different-place/2013/01/a-jedi-mind-trick-and-three-other-approaches-to-learning-vocabulary) -- namely [Lang-8](http://lang-8.com/), [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/), spaced repetition, mnemonics etc -- so I'm trying out something new: posting the audio of the interview I did a few days ago.

Gabe's book is worth your time, especially if you're getting back into learning languages, or if you're starting for the first time. If you have less patience for books and the written word, you can [watch his course](https://www.creativelive.com/courses/become-fluent-any-language-gabriel-wyner) over on CreativeLive. It's 18-hours of instruction (in an classroom environment) on how to learn a language using his method. All the steps outlined in his book are expanded upon in this course. I have watched it all, and can attest to its value.

The interview can be listened to [here](http://www.sourcesandmethods.com/podcast/2014/10/2/sources-and-methods-4-gabriel-wyner).

**UPDATE: I now offer one-on-one language coaching. [Read more](http://www.alexstrick.com/language-coaching) about what it involves and what kinds of problems it's best suited to addressing.**
