I'm about to start a large archive translation project (together with [Felix Kuehn](http://www.felixkuehn.com) and [Anand Gopal](http://www.anandgopal.com)).
We're looking for some high-quality translators to work full-time on a project translating old newspapers and magazines from Pashto (and a small amount of Dari) into English.

The work would be 5 days per week, but you will be free to work from home. I.e. there will almost certainly not be any office for you to work from.

The project will take place over the course of a year, with a possible extension to a second year. We would initially hire you for a trial period before committing to hire you for the full year.

If you're interested, please head on over to the form here and fill it out. We'll get back to you in due course, if and when we're ready to start the hiring process.

UPDATE (JULY): We've stopped taking applications and are working on finalising the hiring process. Thanks for all your interest!
