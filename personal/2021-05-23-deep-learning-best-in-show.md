Deep Learning is an incredibly powerful technology and there are a number of (focused / specific) areas where it already surpasses human-level abilities. Here are some examples:

1. Translation: If you haven't been watching closely, the quality of Google Translate translations has really been improved in recent years. [This 2016 story](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/magazine/the-great-ai-awakening.html) is a little dated, but it explains how they made a big push a few years back and it continues to improve as the technology improves.
2. X-ray interpretation: In a matter of a few years, the performance of Deep Learning in reading and making diagnoses from x-rays has surpassed top radiology practitioners. See how DeepMind [raised the bar](https://deepmind.com/research/publications/International-evaluation-of-an-artificial-intelligence-system-to-identify-breast-cancer-in-screening-mammography) on identifying breast cancer.
3. Playing Go: Watch [the AlphaGo documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y) if you haven't already.
4. Protein Folding: Check out [AlphaFold](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology) from last November, where DeepMind blasted through a notoriously complicated problem in biology.
5. Colourising images: A former fast.ai student, Jason Antic, made great progress with his work on [DeOldify](https://blog.floydhub.com/colorizing-and-restoring-old-images-with-deep-learning/).

The really great thing about the [fastai](https://www.fast.ai) course is how it successfully has managed to democratise Deep Learning as a technology. I always enjoy reading about niche areas where specific burning problems were solved because someone took the opportunity to educate themselves.
