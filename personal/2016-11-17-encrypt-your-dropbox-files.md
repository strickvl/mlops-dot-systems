Much has been written about securing your digital life since the conclusion of the US election. (This was [one of the better posts](https://theintercept.com/2016/11/12/surveillance-self-defense-against-the-trump-administration/), I thought.) It's worth doing this regardless of whatever is going on in the politics of country x or y. If the country is big enough, it's going to want to suck your digital life up into its archives one way or another. So why make it easy for them?

Encrypting your Dropbox is one of the low-hanging fruit when it comes to securing your digital life. Most of us store various files in the Dropbox cloud, and they're just sitting there unencrypted unless you take specific action. Moreover, [Dropbox has been hacked](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/31/dropbox-hack-passwords-68m-data-breach) before ([more than once](http://www.zdnet.com/article/dropbox-gets-hacked-again/)).

Fortunately, Boxcryptor exists to package everything up in an encrypted form. It's a paid service, and worth every cent. [Sign up by clicking here](https://www.boxcryptor.com/app/referral/?code=Jhn1STOetFRt7IDC).
