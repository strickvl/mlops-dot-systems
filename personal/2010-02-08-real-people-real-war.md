Newspapers, politicians and the military on both sides of the Atlantic are [salivating](http://www.captainsjournal.com/2010/02/03/announcing-the-marja-offensive/) at the prospect of a great clash in Marjah (Helmand) in the coming days -- "the most dangerous areas of central Helmand in a series of daring raids — the biggest since the first Gulf war" ([Sunday Telegraph, UK](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/onthefrontline/7177157/Afghanistan-4000-British-troops-set-for-biggest-battle-with-Taliban.html)) -- and you'd be forgiven for forgetting the [human cost](http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5g8ceYiSC4HPcofeaI9EaH3s_q35Q).
Good thing that we have Holly Pickett's [latest blog post](http://hollypickett.blogspot.com/2010/02/hospital-on-edge.html) to remind us that war affects real people with real lives -- strategise all you like, but remember all of this is about people in the end.  Holly's photos are hard to look at.  That's the point.

Go there.  Look at them.  Think.  Then act.
