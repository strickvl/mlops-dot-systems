As I reach the final stages of [a major project](http://www.hurstpublishers.com/book/the-taliban-reader/), I’ve been saying ‘no’ more often. I’ve been turning down work, conferences and all the little things that take away from my ability to focus for hours at a stretch.

The other day I realised that my usual clampdown on notifications on my various digital devices wasn’t as tight as I ideally prefer, so I turned them all off. (You can read how to turn off iOS notifications [here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201925), and Android notifications [here](http://www.droid-life.com/2012/11/29/how-to-disable-android-application-notifications-beginners-guide/).) I’m writing down the various parts of this in case it’s useful to someone else in the midst of a big project.

In practice, this means the following:

- no [badges](http://www.iphonefaq.org/archives/97932) on apps on my screen. (The software on your phone is designed to be addictive, to make you spend more time using it. I already [live my life in black-and-white](https://www.alexstrick.com/blog/2016/8/remove-your-colour) so that’s a start, but removing app badges is the next step.)
- permanently set to [airplane mode](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204234). (This is easy for me as my work or life doesn’t ever really involve receiving phone calls, but it removes the chance of business / telemarketing distractions.)
- all other apps’ notification permissions turned off. (If someone messages me on WhatsApp or Signal, I will never ever get a notification about it. My phone won’t make a noise, nor will there be any badge showing that there are people who tried to get in touch with me. The *only* way I’ll ever see if anyone wrote to me on a messaging app is to open up that app. I do this perhaps once a day, sometimes only a couple of times a week, but I’ve conditioned myself to this level of withdrawal over the past year or two).
- Email permanently disabled on my phone. (Email is the big focus killer. If I generalise, it amounts to a box of other people’s requests on my time. So I have no way to receive email on my phone. I have things set up that I can *send* email (i.e. I’ve installed the SMTP login details but not enabled IMAP), but no way to receive it.)

I have a fixed schedule for things like checking email: two windows from 12-1pm and 5-6pm. Outside those windows, my email is disabled (using [Freedom](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204234)) so there’s no way for me to access it. On my laptop, a whole bunch of other sites whose addresses are easy to type and get lost on, I pre-empt my worst self by just disabling them during the day. Problem solved.

Whenever I write a post on this blog, it auto-posts to Twitter, Facebook, Linkedin and Tumblr. While the temptation might be to check to see who has commented on it and so on, by locking myself out on a specific schedule, this means I can choose to look at these things at the end of the day, if I really need/want to.
