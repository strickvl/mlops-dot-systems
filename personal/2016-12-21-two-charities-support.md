If you do any kind of end-of-year charitable donations, now would be a good time to support one or both of these organisations.

CAGE works in the UK to advocate on behalf of communities and individuals affected by the so-called War on Terror. They occupy a niche space among UK-based NGOs and the work they do is unique and important. Contribute to their campaign [here](https://www.igiveonline.com/uk/campaigns/supporting-cage-a-time-for-courage/).

The Kabul Mobile Mini-Circus for Children is a group that I’ve fundraised for in the past. I visited them a few years back in Kabul and it was one of the happiest places I’ve been to. The children seemed to love being there, exploring what they could do through learning new skills, working with each other and so on. They’re building a new training / social / educational centre, and you can support their campaign [here](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/kabulcircus/).
