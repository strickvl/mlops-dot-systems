[Good article](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/54cf9eca-10e5-11df-9a9e-00144feab49a,Authorised=false.html?_i_location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F0%2F54cf9eca-10e5-11df-9a9e-00144feab49a.html%3Fftcamp%3Drss&_i_referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.silobreaker.com%2Farmy-pins-hopes-for-kandahar-on-old-foe-5_2263207339332993027&ftcamp=rss) in yesterday's Financial Times newspaper on Amir Mohammad Agha, very much a so-called 'key player' in Arghandab district of Kandahar province.  Matt Green outlined why he might be important to the viability of US forces in the district, possibly (although I don't know this) invited down there by the 82nd Airborne to impress on Amir Mohammad Agha the importance of which way he decides to choose.  In any case, I don't imagine any 'decision' taken by Amir Mohammad Agha to be public and clear-cut.
I was greatly disappointed, however, that Matt missed out on the key point when it comes to Amir Mohammad Agha -- he is Mullah Mohammad Omar's father-in-law.  (and with that, he also missed the extremely important 1980s context and just how involved Amir Mohamad Agha was involved in the early years of the Taliban movement post-1994.
