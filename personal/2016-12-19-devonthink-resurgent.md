There has never been a better time to get into DevonThink and Tinderbox. [Winterfest 2016](http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/Specials/WinterFest.html) is on, and you can get 25% reductions on both those apps, as well as a number of other really useful pieces of software like Scrivener, TaskPaper, Bookends, Scapple and PDFPen.

If you’re unsure if DevonThink is something you’d be interested in, they have a 150-hours-of-use free trial for all their different apps. MacPowerUsers podcast just released [a useful overview](https://www.relay.fm/mpu/356) of the current state of the app — an interview with Stuart Ingram. ScreenCastsOnline also [published the first part](https://screencastsonline.com/mac/show/0586/) of a trilogy of video learning materials on DevonThink.

If you’re a Mac user who is perhaps uncomfortable with [Evernote’s privacy policies](http://www.macdrifter.com/2016/12/evernote-humans-and-machines.html) or just seeking to get more out of the data you’ve stored on your hard drive, give DevonThink a try.
