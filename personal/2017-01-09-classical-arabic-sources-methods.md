[The new Arabic podcast](https://soundcloud.com/ma-wara-al-logha) I started has three episodes out of [the Jordanian dialect series](https://soundcloud.com/ma-wara-al-logha/sets/jordanian-arabic-dialect). Today I'm adding to those with [a new series exploring classical literature](https://soundcloud.com/ma-wara-al-logha/sets/literary-caravans-1). I'm extremely pleased to be joined by my friend, the erudite [Talha Ahsan](http://arabic-tutor.co.uk/), someone who has a strong appreciation for the subject matter and who teaches Arabic online and in person in the UK. Read [some of the testimonials](http://arabic-tutor.co.uk/testimonials/) from his former students here.

In our first episode, we discuss [Ibn al-Muqafaa'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_al-Muqaffa%27) and Talha's interest in classical literature. We get into Ibn al-Muqaffa's relevance to the modern age and explain what we hope this podcast series will do.

Sources and Methods has [a new podcast out today](https://www.sourcesandmethods.com/podcast/35-inbetweenisode), too. This is an 'inbetweenisode' in which Matt and I discuss the past year, what we've been up to recently and some of our future plans. [Let us know](https://www.sourcesandmethods.com/contact/) if you enjoyed this style of episode. We were thinking of doing more of these conversations between us where we take a deep-dive into a particular topic.
