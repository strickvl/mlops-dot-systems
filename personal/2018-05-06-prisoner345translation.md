I’ve been sitting on this for a while.

Early in 2017, I was lucky to get put in touch with Sami Al-Hajj and al-Jazeera by a good friend. They were looking for someone to translate Sami’s memoirs from Arabic into English. I had done similar work in the past, working Zaeef’s memoirs from his Guantánamo time that later expanded into [*My Life With the Taliban*](https://www.amazon.com/Life-Taliban-Abdul-Salam-Zaeef-ebook/dp/B00GGMT9ZS/ref=sr_1_1_twi_kin_2?sr=8-1&ie=UTF8&keywords=my%2Blife%2Bwith%2Bthe%2Btaliban&tag=soumet-20&qid=1525579036). I had never done any serious translation from Arabic, however, particularly of this length.

I finished translating a while back. It was both harder and more enjoyable than I had expected. Harder in that it requires an intense focus that can’t really let up while the translation is happening. More enjoyable since I realised the process was something that brought in a lot of creativity to get the language ‘just right’.

Today, Sami’s memoirs [have been published](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/05/guantanamo-prison-survivor-sami-al-hajj-shares-story-180505151911693.html). You can [download the PDF version](https://interactive.aljazeera.com/aje/2018/prisoner345/index.html) via Al-Jazeera [here](https://interactive.aljazeera.com/aje/2018/prisoner345/index.html). It looks like Kindle and iBooks versions will be made available in due course as well.

I hope you get a chance to give this book a read. Not only is it some work that I spent a good chunk of time working on, but it’s a really useful and moving account of someone who passed through Guantánamo. In particular, Sami was often on a hunger strike so there is a lot of detail on his mental state and coping mechanisms, as well as the way the medical authorities at Guantánamo attempted to 'deal' with the problem.
