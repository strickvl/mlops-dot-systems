I have been working on the ISAF press releases data again. Just as a little teaser, here's a chart comparing the first fifteen days of January in 2011, 2012 and 2013. It shows the number of ISAF operations in which someone was captured or killed (as reported in their press releases).

[caption id="" align="alignnone" width="842"][![chart2](images/2013-01-15-isafs-first-fifteen-days/d7dfb4495ef0_chart21.avif)](http://static.squarespace.com/static/544a27a7e4b042df02dea00c/544a2abfe4b017ad0e2a476a/544a2ac0e4b017ad0e2a47d3/1358261535000/chart21.png?format=original) chart2[/caption]

The second chart compares the numbers of operations carried out over the course of the first fifteen days of the month, as well as the numbers of people who were killed or detained during the course of those operations.

The third chart compares the numbers of leaders and facilitators who were removed from the fight in some way (either killed or detained).

Note that all the data for the above charts comes from ISAF's press release reporting. ISAF under-report incidents, so there will have been more operations and deaths and detentions etc than are mentioned here.
