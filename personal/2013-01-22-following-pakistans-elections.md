[Saba Imtiaz](http://www.sabaimtiaz.com), a freelance journalist based in Karachi, has started a daily newsletter of updates relating to Pakistan's upcoming elections -- scheduled to take place this summer. She explains what she'll be offering in [a recent blogpost](http://sabaimtiaz.com/blog/2013/1/22/public-service-announcement-the-election-watch):
> Along with a round-up of the headlines and commentary from English, Urdu and Sindhi news sources, I’ll also be writing smaller profiles of candidates and major news issues, as well as doing smaller data dumps on voting patterns
