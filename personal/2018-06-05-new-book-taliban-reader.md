My new book is out (finally). The Taliban Reader is somehow the culmination of years of work to drive studies of the Taliban back to primary sources. Some of this work was accidental; more recently it was more purposeful. The book I produced (together with [Felix Kuehn](https://www.felixkuehn.com)) is long and detailed.

Comments and feedback [prior to publication](https://www.hurstpublishers.com/book/the-taliban-reader/) were extremely positive. It'll presumably take readers a while to start getting some real independent reviews in, but I look forward to feedback and whatever conversation is generated off the back of it all.

You can pick up a copy at any good bookshop or from Amazon [here](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Taliban-Reader-War-Islam-Politics/dp/1849048096/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1528206117&sr=8-1&keywords=taliban+reader).
