[Matt](https://twitter.com/MattTrevithick) and I were lucky to get [Jonathan Brown on the podcast](http://www.sourcesandmethods.com/podcast/2015/9/14/sources-and-methods-23-jonathan-brown) for an episode that came out this week. [Check it out](http://www.sourcesandmethods.com/podcast/2015/9/14/sources-and-methods-23-jonathan-brown) for his work on authority and sourcing in the Islamic tradition, a discussion of how he picks the examples that end up in his books and the current state of Islamic studies.
