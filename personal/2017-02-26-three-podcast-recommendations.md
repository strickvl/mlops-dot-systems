I've been walking around more this past week, and have added some new listening material into my podcast quiver. So if you're interested in something outside your usual information diet, give these three a try:

- [Slate's Stranger Than Fiction](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/slates-stranger-than-fiction/id642445284?mt=2). Conversations with science-fiction authors about the intersection of their writing with technology and the contemporary world. This podcast is no longer produced and there are only 6 episodes (dating back to 2013).
- [Pod Save the World](https://getcrookedmedia.com/pod-save-the-world-7cc67d64dd56#.pnq5watff). Conversations with people who were involved in American foreign policy decisions. This is part of a series of new podcasts put out by some former Obama-government staff members (aka [Crooked Media](https://getcrookedmedia.com/)). The foreign policy discussions are often interesting and they offer behind-the-scenes glimpses of how certain deals were made. So far we've heard about the Cuba and Iran deals made under Obama.
- [Arms Control Wonk](http://www.armscontrolwonk.com/podcast/). A discussion podcast about nuclear weapons. It's a fairly opinionated glance at some pretty down-in-the-weeds topics relating to nuclear security, particularly from the US perspective, but given that North Korean nuclear weapons are likely to be a big deal in 2017 this is a useful one to follow.
