If you go over to [sourcesandmethods.com](http://www.sourcesandmethods.com/) you'll find the inaugural episode of a new podcast I'm doing together with Matt Trevithick. Seriously, go there now and have a listen. You'll be able to subscribe from the iTunes directory etc in about a week or so, but for now if you want to hook it up to your preferred podcast client, use the RSS feed provided.

Matt and I wanted to do this partly as an excuse to talk to interesting people, but also out of a sense that there is a certain type of person who gets interviewed less than they ought (if at all). So here's hoping that we keep interviewing interesting people, esp those who aren't already saturating the media.

Head on over and give it a try. [Anand](http://www.anandgopal.com/) talks about things he's never talked about in a public forum (as far as I'm aware).

UPDATE: You can [subscribe here](http://www.sourcesandmethods.com/subscribe).
