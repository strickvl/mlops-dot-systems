Very please to see the New York Times article this morning on the use of child soldiers in Afghanistan's security services. Read it [here](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/30/world/asia/30afghan.html?pagewanted=print). Above is a photo I took back in February 2008 in Kandahar after the death of Abdul Hakim Jan. The boy said he was 19 years old.
