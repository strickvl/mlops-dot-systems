I'm currently scheduled to do some archival work in August that would greatly benefit from being able to understand written Italian. That's a little under two months away from now, so I've been thinking about how best to approach this problem.

I'm only interested in comprehension, and not in production, of language, so this would seem a great opportunity to get a little bit of grammar and then immerse myself in some [comprehensible input](http://www.languagesurfer.com/2013/09/28/part-iii-the-input-hypothesis/). I bought a quick-and-basic grammar overview and have set myself up with [Clozemaster](https://www.clozemaster.com/). ([Clozemaster](https://www.clozemaster.com/) is a great way to learn vocabulary through context. I wrote about it previously [here](https://www.alexstrick.com/blog/clozemaster).)

I'm posting about this less-than-two-month mini goal here for a little bit of public accountability. I will in no way be fluent by the end of it, but I hope to be able to make my way through an archive of materials in Italian, or at the very least to know what is worth properly translating and what I can skip over.

There's rumoured to be a Beeminder/Clozemaster direct service connection in the works, but until then I'll use Clozemaster's own daily reminder tool. *A più tardi*.
