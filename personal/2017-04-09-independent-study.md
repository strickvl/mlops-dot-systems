*[This is a continuation of Taylor's blog series where she details some of the week-in-week-out lessons that she learns through her Arabic studies and* [*coaching work*](http://languagecoach.io/coaching)*together with me. For other posts in the series,*[*click here.*](https://www.alexstrick.com/blog/?tag=taylorjournal#show-archive)*]*

For some Arabic students (myself, certainly), when we first start to learn about the diglossia in Arabic, we feel somewhat cheated, like, "I signed up to learn a language, and now you're telling me that I need to learn some second, shadow language if I'm actually to use it?" It's like the rug is pulled out from beneath our feet, like we'd be studying Shakespeare and are frustrated to find that real people actually speak [Singlish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pb4XSy-d2Ck). Colleagues who work in journalism/research repeatedly encouraged me to study dialect, which led me to leave my last *fusha* course for an *ammiya* one at Sijal.

Happily, it doesn't feel nearly so intimidating as I once imagined when I turned on some *ammiya* YouTube videos and despaired that a year in MSA classes seemed to do me no good. Indeed, the listening comprehension and vocabulary I learned at Qasid feels like a swiss army knife I now use to pick a new lock. Also, another useful tool from my MSA classes – an extreme comfort with not understanding many of the words I'm hearing but still staying engaged and hanging on for the ones I do.

On a related note, Alex has encouraged me to keep up independent reading even as I'm in a course that largely focuses on speaking and listening. That's another skill that I appreciate from my time at Qasid – the willingness to dive into a text, even when many of the words are ones I don't recognize, and look for the keys that will give me some clue about it. I'm a pen-and-paper learner, so I've been printing out media articles and reading them through twice, no dictionary, then underlining words I don't know and making my best guess at what they mean.

For example, this week I read [one in the Huffington Post](http://www.huffpostarabi.com/2017/03/26/story_n_15618920.html) about scientists questioning whether we need to drink eight cups of water a day. The piece mentioned drinking a sufficient amount of water so that "البول" is "واضح اللون أو خفيف الصفرة." I didn't know that first word, but I was delighted to know exactly what it was as soon as I read the rest of the sentence. I'm convinced that process of discovery is a powerful learning tool, more so than having translations readily at hand to answer our doubts as soon as we have them.

Also, having a bit more free time, I've been able to take advantage of events going on around me to get extra-classroom contact with the language. I sat in on a Sunday morning lecture from an Al Jazeera filmmaker who produced an extraordinary [documentary](http://www.aljazeera.net/programs/private-investigation/2017/2/12/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B7%D9%81%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B0%D9%8A-%D8%A3%D8%B4%D8%B9%D9%84-%D8%AB%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%A9), "The Boy Who Started the Syrian War." His discussion afterwards was well above my level, and I only got the outlines of what he was saying, which is still far more than I would have gotten just three months ago when I came to Amman. It was still, of course, a very useful experience. For example, he used the word نظام always when I was expecting him to say حكومة, which led me to ask and confirm with my teacher that it seems to be used like we say "regime" in English, or, a disdainful/pejorative word for a government.

Being someone who spends plenty of time in the kitchen (because organic vegetarian food doesn't make itself, at least not anywhere walking distance from me =) I'm a big podcast fan. Alex's on [Jordanian ammiya](https://www.7iber.com/events/2017-04/) is great listening for me at my current level – when I tried this just a few months ago, it was beyond my grasp. I also like the BBC Arabic service and DW's [current events](http://www.dw.com/ar/%D8%AA%D9%84%D9%81%D8%B2%D9%8A%D9%88%D9%86/%D9%83%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%BA%D8%A7/s-10109) discussion panel.

And repeating what I wrote in my last post – an upcoming post will be some reflections on accents and errors and embarrassment and the ways we as language learners judge ourselves (and others? I hope not. I indeed only judge myself when it comes to foreign language ability, which may point to, as Alex says, how much language is a confidence game). I'm on a scale between sheepish and chatterbox depending on what situation I'm in, and I've been chewing over what it is about a given situation that makes me feel either of those ways.
