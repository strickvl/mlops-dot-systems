I was interviewed by Kris Broholm on the [Actual Fluency podcast](http://actualfluency.com/actual-fluency-language-learning-podcast/) last week. This was a real pleasure to do, since I've been listening to that podcast more or less since it first started.

You can [listen to the interview/episode here](http://actualfluency.com/afp-104-alex-strick-van-linschoten/). Our conversation was fairly wide-ranging, covering topics like whether to start Arabic by learning the spoken or written form first, how to learn languages when there isn't much in the way of materials available, and what kinds of meta-skills I've found useful in my own language learning journey as well as that of [the students I coach](http://languagecoach.io/coaching).
