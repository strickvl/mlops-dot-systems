*This is the first in a series of posts I'll be doing on this blog detailing some software or web services that I use. I'll try to end each post with two examples of things I've used the software for recently.*
[Pinboard](http://pinboard.in/) is an online bookmarking service. I save all the articles I read online there with a handy bookmarklet, and everything I read in Instapaper and via twitter also gets saved there. Even better, if you upgrade to a premium subscription, Pinboard's servers will make an archive copy of the site so even if it is taken offline, you'll still have a copy of the site. And before you say that other services do it better, [read this](http://blog.pinboard.in/2010/11/bookmark_archives_that_don_t/).

It's handy for sharing collated link collections with people and it's useful just as an archive of everything you've been reading.

Two recent uses of Pinboard:

1. I keep a rolling list of all the reviews and comments on my recent edited book, *Poetry of the Taliban*. You can see this [here](https://pinboard.in/u:strickvl/bundle:TalibanPoetry/). These kinds of lists are great for sharing with other people.
2. The other day I remembered I had read something online, but couldn't quite remember where, so I searched within my Pinboard archive (including the text of all the websites I'd visited and read articles from in the past two weeks), finding the article within seconds.
